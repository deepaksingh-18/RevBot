## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Microphone Permission Denied**
   - Ensure your browser has permission to access the microphone
   - Check browser settings and allow microphone access

2. **API Key Issues**
   - Verify your Gemini API key is correct
   - Check that the API key has the necessary permissions
   - Ensure you're not exceeding rate limits

3. **Audio Not Working**
   - Check if your microphone is properly connected
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Check browser console for errors

4. **Connection Issues**
   - Ensure the server is running on the correct port
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify network connectivity
